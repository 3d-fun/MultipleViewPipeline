VW doesn't distribute the protobuf .proto files, so for now we copy them
into this dir and include them in our project.

This should become obsolete when VW starts distributing their protobuf
files.

To add these to a project, simply add the following before a PROTOBUF_GENERATE_CPP:

set(_protobuf_include_path -I ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/thirdparty/vw_protobuf)
