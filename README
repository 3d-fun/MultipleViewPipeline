1. INTRODUCTION

A. Neo-Geography Toolkit

The Neo-Geography Toolkit (NGT) is a collection of tools for automated
processing of geospatial data, including images and maps. It is capable
of processing raw raster data from remote sensing instruments and
transforming it into useful cartographic products, such as visible image
base maps, topographic models, etc. Additionally, components of the NGT
can perform data processing on extremely large geospatial data sets (up
to several tens of terabytes) via parallel processing pipelines.
Finally, it can also transform raw metadata (i.e.  SPICE kernels and PDS
image labels), vector data (e.g., 2D/3D shape files), and geo-tagged
data sets into standard NeoGeography data formats, such as KML.  NGT is
an evolving collection of loosely connected open-source modules designed
by the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group. Modules of the NGT will be
released one at a time, as they reach maturity. To date, we have
completed only one module: the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline, but more will
soon follow. Check this website for the latest updates.

B. Multiple View Pipeline

The NASA Multiple View Pipeline (MVP) is a suite of automated geodesy &
stereogrammetry tools designed for processing planetary imagery captured
from orbiting and landed robotic explorers on other planets. It was
designed to process stereo imagery captured by NASA spacecraft and
produce cartographic products including digital elevation models (DEMs),
ortho-projected imagery, and 3D models. These data products are suitable
for science analysis, mission planning, and public outreach.

This software differentiates itself from another NGT product, Ames
Stereo Pipeline, in this software novel technique to utilize multiple
views to construct elevation. This provides better resolved terrain
and robustness against image noise.

The Multiple-View Pipeline (AMVP) models the entire image 
formation process and find the optimal height for each DEM post given 
every available orbital image. Complex terrain and reflectance models 
are simplified by assuming planar terrain and a linear reflectance model 
on a small patch around a given DEM post.
