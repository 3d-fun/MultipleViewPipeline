The Ames Multiple-View Pipeline

The Ames Multiple-View Pipeline (AMVP) will model the entire image 
formation process and find the optimal height for each DEM post given 
every available orbital image. Complex terrain and reflectance models 
are simplified by assuming planar terrain and a linear reflectance model 
on a small patch around a given DEM post.
