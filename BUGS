Detecting boost
---------------

The boost detection in cmake is buggy for boosts installed outside
system paths. Sometimes it will detect the correct boost for the headers
but pull in the system boost libraries which might be at a different
version. It would be a good idea to run ldd or otool -L to make sure 
the correct libraries are being pulled.
