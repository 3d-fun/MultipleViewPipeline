Interesting feature in 2682_1937_12.real.job:

[seed georef] = ts_genseed([32 32], tile_georef, -1091, "tangent", [10 10 1]);
options = mvpoptimset(2000);

Vary seed from [7 50] to [14 50] to see the discontinuity:

[trash georef] = ts_genseed([7 50], tile_georef, -1091, "tangent", [10 10 1]);
ts_plotobj(seed, georef, images, options)
[trash georef] = ts_genseed([8 50], tile_georef, -1091, "tangent", [10 10 1]);
ts_plotobj(seed, georef, images, options)
  ... and so on

This feature becomes invisible at window size 13 or so.
